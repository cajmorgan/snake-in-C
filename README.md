# Gameplay
![Gameplay in terminal](/material/img1.png)

You use the keyarrows on the computer to choose the direction to go.
Purple carrots are the food and score and the rest are different powerups/downgrades. Try them out! 

This is also counting highscore so play it to the end and the highscore will be saved for next time.
